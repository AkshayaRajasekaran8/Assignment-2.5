1. Explain what is a cluster and what is a hadoop cluster.
 -Cluster:
       *A cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically 
        for the purpose of storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data 
        in a computing environment which is distributed in nature.
       *It distributes the data analysis workload across multiple cluster nodes that 
        work to process the data in parallel.
       *The benefit of clusters is its scalability.
       *Clusters are resistant to failures.

 -Hadoop cluster:
       *Hadoop cluster boosts the speed of data analysis applications.
       *A computer cluster used for Hadoop is called Hadoop Cluster. 
       *Hadoop clusters are scalable and highly resistant to failures.
       *Hadoop cluster is designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of 
         unstructured data.
       *Hadoop clusters are composed of three types of node: 
        -master nodes
        -worker nodes
        -client nodes. 
      *Hadoop cluster will run in low cost commodity hardwares.
      *Clusters of three or more machines typically use a single NameNode and ResourceManager
       with all the other nodes as slave nodes. 


2. Explain the components of Hadoop 1.x.

  -The components of hadoop are:                
   1)HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System takes the data breaks them into pieces 
            and then distributes them to different nodes in a cluster and thus allows the parallel processing.     
     -The two components of HDFS are:
           -Namenode
           -Datanode
     *Namenode:
               -A namenode stores the metadata.
               -A namenode acts as the master node.        
               -It stores the information about the datanodes like  how many blocks of data
                   are stored in the nodes,locations of nodes,which node holds the data,etc.
     *Secondary namenode:
              -Secondary namenodes performs the activity of house-keeping for the name nodes like 
                periodic merging and it is used for edits.
     *Datanode:
              -The data nodes nodes are used to store the actual data.
              -The datanode acts as slave nodes.     
              -It stores the data in terms of blocks.The default size of the block is 64MB.
              -The data node acts as heart beat of the name node as it periodically sends signals to the name node
                to check whether it is active currently.
